# Raise Up Network
The Birmingham Education Foundation (Ed) is dedicated to increasing the number of students in the Birmingham City Schools that are on the path to college, career, and life readiness. We believe that this is only possible by cultivating a diverse network of people who demand excellence for our students and inspire others to do the same.

##Network Night

Imagine 100+ students, educators, families, local residents, and community partners coming together every 6 weeks to build relationships, connect, and exchange ideas, opportunities, and concerns, in order to commit to collective action. That’s what [Network Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI0qip6XlZc) is all about! During the gathering, we use “Network Devices” like sharing what’s new and good in our lives, hosting conversations in small groups, exchanging requests and offers from one another and committing to action steps as a Network.

## Network Asset Database

In order to reach our Network membership and action goals it is imperative that we maintain organization of our data, communication, and progress. The Network Asset Database, aka [edbirmingham/network](https://github.com/edbirmingham/network), is being developed to increase Ed’s Network activity; maintaining Membership records, supporting stewardship (progress to requests/offers between Network members), and increasing access and awareness to school/community based assets.

## Project Members

Please join us as we work to help Birmingham's kids by using technology to improve the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) of Network Nights.
