# Hacktember 2015

For the last 2 years, BOSS has put on a month-long project-based hackathon
called Hacktember.  David Wilkins came up with the idea and I (Josh) have always
really enjoyed it and look forward to it each year.

Normally we use meetups to organize them, but we're a bit late this year w/r/t
organization.  However, this year we also have the excellent Magic City Tech
slack group to take advantage of to help publicize it, so we're hoping for a
good bit of involvement.

In previous years, we've seen projects ranging from mapping datasets in the
browser, to an arduino-based hydroponics system, to autonomous gliders.  There's
really no limit to what the project can be, so long as it has some open source
component.

In the September BOSS meeting on September 28, we'll all show off the projects
and it's always a great time.

## What experience level is necessary to be involved? 

Anyone is welcome to get involved.  They're projects, so there will always be something that someone of any skill level can contribute to - documentation, user interface, manual testing, general brainstorming, etc.  Don't feel like just because you're not a kernel hacker you have nothing to offer!

## Projects

To add a project you'd like to work on, please send a Pull Request to this
repository, adding it to the list below and adding a subdirectory in this repo
that has a README in it describing your project.  Then link the entry in this
list to your README.  To join a project, send a Pull Request to this repository
adding yourself to this list underneath the project you'd like to help with.
I'll add an example project to make it clear what I mean.
