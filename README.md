# Hacktember 2015

For the last 2 years, BOSS has put on a month-long project-based hackathon
called Hacktember.  David Wilkins came up with the idea and I (Josh) have always
really enjoyed it and look forward to it each year.

Normally we use meetups to organize them, but we're a bit late this year w/r/t
organization.  However, this year we also have the excellent Magic City Tech
slack group to take advantage of to help publicize it, so we're hoping for a
good bit of involvement.

In previous years, we've seen projects ranging from mapping datasets in the
browser, to an arduino-based hydroponics system, to autonomous gliders.  There's
really no limit to what the project can be, so long as it has some open source
component.

In the September BOSS meeting on September 28, we'll all show off the projects
and it's always a great time.

## Projects

describing your project.  Then link the entry in this list to your README.  To
join a project, send a Pull Request to this repository adding yourself to this
list underneath the project you'd like to help with.  I'll add an example
project to make it clear what I mean.
